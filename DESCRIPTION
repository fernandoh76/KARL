Description: Throughout the functionalities provided by KARL the user can predict the taxonomic position (from domain to genus) of a certain genome by using the metabolic fea
tures coded inside it as well as comparing the distribution of enzymes and pathways along all the available prokaryotic taxa. The package is divided in three modules called 
Explorer, Predictor and Updater.
