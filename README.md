# KARL

KARL comes from proKaryotes tAxonomy pRedcition using genome-encoded metaboLic features. This package was designed with the intention of exploiting the enormous amount of genomic data that is being constantly produced since some years ago for an increasing diversity of prokaryotes. The main aim of KARL is to provide a stable framework to fill the gap between exploration of genome-encoded metabolic signatures (that can be thought as omics-fashioned chemotaxonomic traits) and the organism taxonomic position. Throughout the functionalities provided inside KARL, the user can predict the taxonomic position (from domain to genus) of a certain genome by using the metabolic features coded inside it, as well as comparing the distribution of enzymes and pathways along all the available prokaryotic taxa.
